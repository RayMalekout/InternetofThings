# InternetofThings
This code demonstrates the use of object constructor functions to create internet of things objects in a simulated city. The user can create 4 different objects of the type specified in the constructor function. The user clicks on each button from left to right and this will create an object of that type. Clicking the output button at any stage will output an alert of the properties of the objects that currently exist.
